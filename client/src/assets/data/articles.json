The HealthPH team introduced the organizational structure and operational framework of their initiative, highlighting the role of their system in identifying potential health actions, preparing for future pandemics, and utilizing social media to monitor potential outbreaks. They also discussed the use of advanced models and algorithms to detect social media trends indicative of health issues. \nDOH members provided valuable insights and posed critical questions about the application. They discussed recommendations for the proper use of social media data, collaboration in the publication and dissemination of findings, and the impact of policies and their implementation. The DOH's involvement is crucial in leveraging HealthPH's capabilities, as they can provide access to social media data and support the validation and cleansing of data to ensure accuracy. \nSeveral technical and operational queries were addressed during the meeting. These included the functionality of the application, access to social media data, and the integration of another funded project about disease modeling project under DOST-PCHRD. The role of FASSSTER in handling confirmed cases was distinguished from HealthPH's management of informal data sources, such as news articles and social media posts. The discussion also covered the potential beneficiaries of the software, primarily the DOH, and the coordination required for formal communication and follow-up alignment between HealthPH, NU, and designated DOH branch directors. \nThe meeting concluded with a commitment to further discussions and formal communications. Both parties expressed optimism about the project's potential to revolutionize health surveillance and its beneficial impact on public health policy and implementation."
